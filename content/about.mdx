# Hi, I’m Denil Dominic

I'm a Software Engineer and recent DePaul University grad who is focused on crating elegant, high- performing web experiences.

I work with React/Next.js, Tailwind, TypeScript, and Node.js to design, build, and deploy products end-to-end, from API to UI.

I value readable code, thoughtful design, and continuous improvement—and I’m excited to tackle new challenges.
