# Hi, I’m Denil Dominic

I architect and ship **fast, reliable web apps** and **data-heavy systems**.
My work blends product thinking with a strong engineering foundation.

I enjoy turning complex problems into simple, elegant solutions, and
documenting them so others can build on top.

When I’m not coding, I’m learning new tools and contributing to open source.
